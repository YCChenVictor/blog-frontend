### Why?

It helps to build database as correct and quick as possible and fit the demand of user, apps, business.

1.  It provides a preview of how all your tables should connect and what filed are going to be on each table.

1.  **Entity:** Anything in real world

\> weak entity means anything existing because an entity exists; for example, a car belongs to CEO in a company. If the CEO leaves a company, then this CEO car should also be eliminate from database.

2\. **Relation:** define the relationship between entities

3\. **Attribute:** the characteristic of entity

4\. **Cardinality:** define the type of relationship: One-to-One, One-to-Many, May to One, Many-to-Many
