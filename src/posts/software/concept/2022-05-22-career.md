## How?

### timeline

### connections

Advice: Personal referral is much better. At work, establish strong relationship with managers and teammates. When employees leave, keep in touch with them.

I will try my best at work and try to help colleagues but I prefer letting others to notice me without efforts. That is, I will try my best to get things done and try to build meaningful project and contributions to the world. I know this approach takes longer but more real.

### goals

Advice: Tell managers what I want and try to pursue it.

What I want: I want to build a project on art domain someday and hopefully, it can make money for donations.

Given I already have experience in fund raising, business plan, startup, cofounding, economics, ...etc. What I need now is as follow:

* MVP: design robust Apps (design pattern)
* PMF: real experience in solving business problems on software side on customer's point of view
* Profit: I need to know the edge knowledge in art area (NFT...etc)

### interview

Adivce: interview once a year to hone any the skills and update the market informations.
